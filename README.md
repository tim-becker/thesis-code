Senior Thesis: Invertible Transducers and Automaton Groups
==========================================================

This repository implements code used in my senior thesis. Note that it will be
updated fairly frequently.

See [binary\_invertible\_transducer.sage](./binary_invertible_transducer.sage)
for
* An implementation of binary invertible transducers
* Computation and estimation of their groups
* Computation of group representations for abelian transducers

See [abelian\_conjectures.sage](./abelian_conjectures.sage) for current
conjectures which are being tested.
